# Lander Simulation
Auto-lands an object to a specific point on the surface.

G-Fold auto-computes the shortest way in terms of fuel to land on a specific target, based on the current position and velocity of the vessel (witch are unknown due to wind, and atmospheric instabilities) "[G-FOLD: A Real-Time Implementable Fuel Optimal Large Divert Guidance Algorithm for Planetary PinpointLanding](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/marsconcepts2012/pdf/4193.pdf)"
